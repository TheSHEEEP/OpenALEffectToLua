OpenALEffectToLua
=================

Parses an OpenAL effect preset and creates a Lua script to use in our engine.

This is quite possibly not useful to anyone except my self.
I made this to create Lua sound effect files for our engine faster than "parsing" the roughly 100 preset effects of OpenAL by hand.
